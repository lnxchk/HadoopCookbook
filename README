# Hadoop Cookbook

* this makes a mess of the existing Debian / Ubuntu stuff in the current community cookbook. I'll fix that back in soon.

* includes support for RHEL and CentOS.  Any other RPM-based platform could be added, I just don't have the version numbers for what would work with the current hadoop releases.

* sets up hadoop based on the ops suggestions in "Hadoop The Definitive Guide" by Tom White (ISBN: 978-1-449-38973-4) and what we're doing at Admeld

* includes several specific recipes for explicit resource management

## Default recipe

* requires the java cookbook

* sets up the dependencies for the Cloudera RPM repository, the .repo file and the RPM keys

* installs the base hadoop package, assuming hadoop-0.20

## Namenode recipe

* installs the namenode and secondarynamenode packages

* *will eventually also set up the services*

## Jobtracker recipe

* installs the jobtracker package

* *will eventually also set up the service*

## Worker recipe

* installs the tasktracker and datanode packages, as hadoop datanodes should always also be task nodes

* *will eventually also set up the services*

## Hadoop_user recipe

* creates a hadoop user to own the files, hold the ssh keys for communicating in the cluster, and run the java processes

## work to do

* setting up the services so they can be called by chef runs when config files change

* adding config files and templates that would necessarily need to be configured to the specific cluster, like hdfs-site.xml and mapred-site.xml

* potentially add a data bag to allow for locking down of the specific hadoop version 

* possibly add the ssh keys for the hadoop user, at least include instructions on how-to and possibly commented skeleton code
